# **Why?**
 ##   Learn to enjoy the mundane. 
We should never take a boring life for granted, as it is a privilege to have stability and predictability in our daily routines. 
We so easily become complacent and take the simple things in life for granted, such as having a place to sleep, the our enrollment in college, 
or even the ability to walk ourselves to class. Life, on the other hand, may throw something new at us at any moment. A health scare, financial crisis, 
or unexpected loss can turn our lives upside down and make us realize how easily things can go wrong; how easily that boring life can become chaotic. 
My audio project, titled "Shock Not Delivered," calls out the listener who may view their life as mundane. As we follow a person doing the "boring" routines
we all do --- waking up, getting ready, and walking to class --- the audio seems uninteresting, uneventful. However, in a single moment, their life is completely changed.
# **Current Progress**		
Currently, I have a solid full draft that conveys my idea well. In future revisions, I would like to better polish the end, as I feel as if the 
idea becomes foggy and it is hard to understand that the events did not happen, 
they were simply something that could of happened. I'm thinking instead of doing 
a breath to bridge, I simulate a reversing of time, and then return to just 
walking with music.
