# **Why?**
 ##   Learn to enjoy the mundane. 
We should never take a boring life for granted, as it is a privilege to have stability and predictability in our daily routines. 
We so easily become complacent and take the simple things in life for granted, such as having a place to sleep, the our enrollment in college, 
or even the ability to walk ourselves to class. Life, on the other hand, may throw something new at us at any moment. A health scare, financial crisis, 
or unexpected loss can turn our lives upside down and make us realize how easily things can go wrong; how easily that boring life can become chaotic. 
My audio project, titled "Shock Not Delivered," calls out the listener who may view their life as mundane. As we follow a person doing the "boring" routines
we all do --- waking up, getting ready, and walking to class --- the audio seems uninteresting, uneventful. However, in a single moment, their life is completely changed.
# **Reflection On My Work**		
When first working on this project, I went with the idea that it would follow a person throughout their day and the listener would be able to hear as the subject focuses 
on one thing to another. Rather quickly, I realized there were going to be two main problems with that idea: 1)Time and 2) Repetitiveness. In order to fulfil my goal, 
the project would need to be much longer than the allotted 4mins, and even if I completed said goal, the overall piece would become a repetitive formula that would 
quickly become boring to listen to. Because of this, I changed to the current idea and feel as if I have successfully conveyed it. As I have no prior experience with 
Audacity, I decided to learn as I go. This came with the advantage of saving time, however, long term, I probably spent more time redoing things that I discovered have 
a better way of modifying. For example, I realized I can use the 'Fade Tracks" affect, to smoothy transition between audios rather than manually doing it. (*pictured 
below*) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122398220/217090398-4ec96a59-c25e-4327-9988-714da4e2af81.png)
In addition to this, I quickly realized that the more layering of sounds (assuming proper volume control), the more natural the environment sounded, rather than 
isolated. This can be seen in the image below, which shows my desision to maintain the sounds of footsteps and street noises (with muffled and amplificaiton affects) 
which the music was playing, as if you were walking in real life, you'd still hear some of it. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122398220/217091284-bed01c27-19ba-445f-8c17-8b070018d206.png)
When I decided to change my idea, I went with a car crash in the main event. I was struggling with the transition to this event as I didn't want it to feel completely 
random, but I also didn't want it to be expected. To deal with this, I ended up synching when the tonic traffic loudens with the first crash sound made. I feel as if 
this did a good job of not making the event not too jarring to the ears while still being surprising. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122398220/217092407-81cd6b59-b76f-436a-92f7-2237bf8250f3.png)
Once I had my audio clips roughly put in place, I went through and used the spectrogram (*pictured below*) to see where my sounds were cliping, especially during the car crash and when I yell in my recording.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122398220/217091803-d2e1af78-ef0c-4732-a5e9-07a6807093e9.png)
This is what I finally submitted for peer review as I had a solid full draft that conveyed my idea well. However, I wanted to better polish the end, as I felt as if 
the idea became foggy and it was hard to understand that the events did not happen, they were simply something that could of happened. I had already thought of the 
idea of instead of doing a breath to bridge, I could simulate a reversing of time, and then return to just walking with music. Sure enough, my peers agreed that the biggest problem was the muddy ending, as best seen in user *skygel*'s comment ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122398220/217094494-95718cb6-a9ba-4e1d-9447-910342649127.png)
    
Because of the general consensus that the ending was not well done, I went with "plan b" of reversing time by using new assets as well as reversing some of the sounds 
I already implemented, which I think gives a more clear vision of what happened which can be seen below. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122398220/217094758-d0f8426d-9c0d-45b4-b0f0-dda250b7cc28.png)
Overall, I feel as if I was able to clearly convey my idea while also learning Audacity to a fairly deep level. I pushed myself to use harder techniques to make my project sound cleaner and more professional and I am happy with the end result.
