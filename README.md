# **Why?**
        I want to run off the idea of day in the life, but I want to make it more of an introspective look, rather than looking at the outside world. I want to follow a person as they get up, get ready for the day, leave the house to go to daily tasks, the return to home etc. I feel as if often times, many people enter an "autopilot" where they go about their day and don't pay attention to what is happening in the moment, but rather get droned into thoughts, work, etc.; we sometimes even choose to do this by isolating ourselves in headphones. We're always stuck in this loop until a cutting moment, whether that be a jarring sound, a thought provoking word, or something as simple as a deep breath, makes you realize where you are, what you are doing, why you're doing it, only to fall back into a daze as the day passes by. I'd like to capture that, hearing the surrounding noise fading in and out as our awareness of who we are varies throughout the day.
