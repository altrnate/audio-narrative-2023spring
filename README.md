# **Why?**
 ##   I'd like to run off the classic idea of day in the life, but I want to make it more of an introspective look, rather than looking at the outside world. 
 I want to follow a person as they get up, get ready for the day, leave the house 
 to go to daily tasks, the return to home etc. I feel as if often times, many 
 people enter an "autopilot" where they go about their day and don't pay 
 attention to what is happening in the moment, but rather get droned into 
 thoughts, work, etc.; we sometimes even choose to do this by isolating ourselves 
 in headphones. We're always stuck in this loop until a cutting moment, whether 
 that be a jarring sound, a thought provoking word, or something as simple as a 
 deep breath, makes you realize where you are, what you are doing, why you're 
 doing it, only to fall back into a daze as the day passes by. I'd like to 
 capture that, hearing the surrounding noise fading in and out as our awareness 
 of who we are varies throughout the day.

# **Current Progress**		
Currently, I have begun incorporating the stock sounds into my draft to get an idea of structure and pacing. 
Within the aup3 file, I have several tracks each split up by the relative sound (ie footsteps all in one track).
This can also be seen in the screenshot provided for quick reference. In addition to this, the mp3 file provides 
a breif sample of the where the piece is currently at, which as you can see, I've reached the first jarring sound.
Moving forward, I beleive I need to figure out some of the pacing, as I feel as if the piece moves too slow.
